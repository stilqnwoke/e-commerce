Documentation of the E-commerce ReactJS project 

The project is an online e-commerce website. It has authentication, public/private sections and home page with products. 
You can add the products to the shopping cart and proceed to Checkout. I have implemented a payment system using Stripe, which collects real payments. 
Once you make a payment, if you are logged into an account, you have an Orders page, where you can review the orders you made with date and time of making the order 
and order numbers. 

I have used the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques: 

1. Context API (REACT) 
2. Firebase (user authentication + database) 
3. React JS 
4. React Router 
5. Material UI for Icons 
6. React Hooks 
7. Client-side routing 
8. Payment implementation using Stripe
